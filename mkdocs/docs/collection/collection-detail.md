# Collection Detail Page

Each collection gets a collection detail page.

## Collection details
There you can fonfigure additional option for the collection:

- Tracking: Activate to automatically start tracking past and future movies.
- Delete: Delete the collection. This won't delete the movies in the collection and only makes sense for collections you added manually or if you delete the movies in the collection first.

## Movies in Collection

This shows the list of movies in the collection. Movies not part of Auto3t will embed from TMDB and show an "add" button to add and start tracking the movie.
