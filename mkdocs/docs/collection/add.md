# Add a new Collection

Clicking on the "add" button opens a new page with a search bar to search for collections to add.

Start typing to search through themoviedb index. Results are returned as provided by the API.

If available, each collection will show:

- **Artwork**: directly hotlinked from themoviedb
- **Title**
- **ID**: That is themoviedb internal collection ID. Click on the link to open the page on [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org).
- **Description**: Collection description

You can add a collection as "tracking", meaning past and future movies in the collection will also get added automatically as tracking.
