!!! info
    
    Collection metadata is provided by [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Please contribute to this excellent database. To use this API, create your free API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

Collections get automatically imported or matched during the movie import or movie refresh process. Collections imported like that, they will be marked as "not tracking".

Available filters for the collection list are "tracking", "not tracking" or all.
