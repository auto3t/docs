!!! note
    This is early stages. This documentation is not considered complete. Please help improve it.

## Core Concepts

Track:

- TV Shows: Track you favourite TV show and download new episodes as they come out.
- Movies: Add a movie to decide when to start searching for the movie and download your matches.
- Collections (aka Boxsets): Track movies within a collection of movies.
- People: Track your favourite people / artists / performers and automatically track their movies and shows.

Keyword filtering:

- Create logical groups of what additional keywords you want to search for, e.g. resolution, codecs and releases.
- Define defaults
- Allow for overwrites of these defaults

Time:

- Be aware of when it makes sense to start searching for a given media file.
- Time movie searching to official premiere and release dates, allow for delayed searching from that day
- Time TV Show episode/season searching to the dates and times when an episode becomes available

Auto:

- Automate as much as possible
- Allow for manual search and manual intervention

## The Name

**Auto3T** is inspired by the early days of sharing media, the days where one would listen to music and shows *tracked* in magazines and newspapers on an analog radio player with integrated cassette *tape* case, then share, or now *torrent* the recordings with each other. Now do the same, but *automatically*, at least as much as possible, for TV shows and movies.
