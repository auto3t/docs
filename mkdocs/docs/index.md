## Core Concepts

### Track

- **TV Shows**: Track you favourite TV show and download new episodes as they come out.
- **Movies**: Add a movie to decide when to start searching for the movie and download your matches.
- **Collections** (aka Boxsets): Track movies within a collection of movies.
- **People**: Track your favourite people / artists / performers and automatically track their movies and shows.

### Keyword filtering

- Create logical groups of what additional keywords you want to search for, e.g. resolution, codecs and releases.
- Define defaults
- Allow for overwrites of these defaults

### Timing

- Be aware of when it makes sense to start searching for a given media file.
- Time movie searching to official premiere and release dates, allow for delayed searching from that day
- Time TV Show episode/season searching to the dates and times when an episode becomes available

### Auto

- Automate as much as possible
- Allow for manual search and manual intervention

## The Name

**Auto3T** is inspired by the early days of sharing media, the days where one would listen to music and shows *tracked* in magazines and newspapers on an analog radio player with integrated cassette *tape* case and hit record at the right time, then share, or now *torrent* the recordings with each other. Now, this project does the same, but *automatically*, at least as much as possible, for TV shows and movies.
