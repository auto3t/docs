# Show Detail Page

Each show has a dedicated detail page.

## Show Metadata

On top of the detail page you can see various helpful metadata.

Click on "Show details" to show more details and config options for this show.

### Active toggle
Toggle active/inactive the show. If the show is active, the metadata will regularly get refresh with the refresh task. 

Keep it active if you want Auto3t to regularly refresh and search for new episodes. If the show has ended, you also might want to deactivate it here, to stop refreshing it reguarly.

### Search Name
This overwrites the search term when automatically searching for new releases through the indexers. Usually the default show name is working as expected, sometimes you'll need to adjust it, for example if the indexers add a year to the name, to avoid getting incorrect episodes.

### Add Keyword
There you see the kewords defaults you have set on the settings page. You can apply show wide overwrites here. That will get inherited by all episodes.

If a keyword is applied on the show level, you can remove it here. To modify the keyword, go to the settings page.

### Manual Search
You can manually search for show level releases in the indexes. Manual search for a show is only available, if the show status is "Ended".

The release will be valid, if all expected episodes can be identified in the release. Auto3t does not automatically search for show level releases, as that is too unreliable.

## Seasons

You can see the indexed seasons in a list. A "show more" button will show, if there are more seasons than shown in the UI. Seasons are ordered by newest first. The active season is highlighted. The default active season is the newest season that has episodes available.

Future season might show if they are confirmed, but have no episodes defined yet.
