### Episode Status Edit
You can manually edit the episode status here. That shouldn't bee needed if all is going well as that is handled by the automated tasks. Episode status can also be edited in bulk on the season.

## Releases
If Auto3t has found any releases for the episodes they will be showed here. Also ignored releases are showed here. A release will automatically get ignored, if despite the title beeing as expected, does not contain the expected media files as reported by the download client.

## File Metadata
If the release has been archived, additional file and stream metadata will show here. That is as provided by the mediaserver.

The play button opens your mediaserver at the given episode.

## Manual Search for Episode
You can manually search for an episode here. If you regularly need to do this because the releases are not named as the show name, you can update the search name on the show directly.
