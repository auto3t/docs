# People detail Page

Each person has a detail page with additional configuration options.

If there are missing IDs, an edit button will show so you can manually add the corresponding ID. Make sure you populate any missing IDs if you want to track a person.

- **Tracking Movies**: Automatically add movies where this person has a credit and with the release date in the future from "now" as tracking.
- **Tracking TV**: Automatically add TV Shows with this person as cast credit and a premier date in the future from "now" as tracking.
- **Locking**: You can ensure a person remains in Auto3T by locking the person here. Manually added persons are locked by default. Unlocked persons will get removed with the clanup task if they don't have any links to Movies or Shows.
