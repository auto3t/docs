# People

People are indexed from movies and TV shows. Additionally you can activate "tracking" for a person.

## Limitations
There is a possibility for duplicate persons here. Unfortunately matching people between the different databases from tvmaze and TMDB is only possible through assumption. If the name matches exactly and there is no other possible match, **Auto3T** assumes that it is the same person and will assign IDs accordingly otherwise create two person entries.

## Filters

- Filter people where you have activated movie tracking
