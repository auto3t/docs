# Movie Release
Configure how movie releases are tracked. You *need* to pick a target release for movies to be marked as "searching".

## Target Bitrate

Configure the target bitrate for movies you are searching for. That is calculated with the movie duration and the reported file size. Set a +/- % value to allow for a range of acceptable file sizes. Don't be too restrictive here, otherwise no releases might match.

## Target Release

Select at what point you want to search for a movie based on the release status. You can set a delay in days, to delay the searching for a few days after release. That can be of advantage, as sometimes the first releases available are of low quality, spam or otherwise undesirable.

A sensible value is to delay for 5 days after release.
